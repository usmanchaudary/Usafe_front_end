      <h1>Safety Action Meeting</h1>
      <div class="guidBorder"></div>
      <p class="guidPara">
        SAM Safety Action Meetings are structured somewhat differently from the traditional safety meeting. Manager or supervisor leads the group in
        
        discussion and action on safety issues. SAMs are conducted in order to address the specific safety issues (e.g., the communication of an incident
        
        investigation report, a problem to be solve, an issue to be analyzed, or the implementation of new procedure) in a SMART manner."</p>

        <h2>SAM Methodology:</h2>
        <p class="guidPara">Generally, to plan a meeting, the leader</p>

        <p class="guidBullets">• Decides on and writes out the purpose of the meeting</p>
        <p class="guidBullets">• Outlines the facts to be presented</p>
        <p class="guidBullets">• Writes out the question for discussions</p>

        <p class="guidPara">Once the leader has given the group the question for discussion, the next stages of the meeting area for the group to</p>

        <p class="guidBullets">• Brainstorm ideas, together with their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
        <p class="guidBullets">• Select action to take.</p>
        <p class="guidBullets">• Decide who will do what and when</p>

        <p class="guidPara">For this last part, leader can not do any planning and suggestions are contributed by "the participants. Leader, however, still has the responsibility for

          guiding the direction of the meeting. Particularly, each leader should make sure that every meeting ends with specific action " to be taken, including who
          
          will take it - and when "Safety Action meeting is one of the best ways we know to build a safety climate in which a whole group works as a team with all
          
          members pulling together to tackle safety issue in their area. As our outline of a safety action meeting suggests, all members of the group work
          
          together to:
          
          </p>

          <p class="guidBullets">• Identify and analyze safety problems.</p>
          <p class="guidBullets">• Anticipate and prevent possible problems.</p>
          <p class="guidBullets">• Suggest and carry out actions to address those problems and to make their workplace safer.</p>

          <p class="guidPara">
            The ideal to aim for in every work situation is to have people focused on safety, aware " "of their own safety, and concerned about the safety of others,
            
            so that they will do something about unsafe conditions and inform their co-workers about unsafe acts, not just leave it all up to the supervisor. Safety
            
            action meetings encourage this awareness and concern, they enable people to " take this responsibility, and they organize it all. Each Circle is required
            
            to do one SAM per month. Any Manager of the circle can lead the Safety Action Meeting.SAM is recorded on the format OHSMS-F-10-01 and
            
            submitted to the Safety Coordinator. One copy is retained by the circle for the follow up and actions implementation.</p>

            <h2>Characteristics of the questions:</h2>

            <p class="guidBullets">• Focus on issue that requires action.</p>
            <p class="guidBullets">• Manageable within the group's area of responsibility.</p>
            <p class="guidBullets">• Answerable in 15 minutes.</p>
            <p class="guidBullets">• Start with phrases like</p>

            <p class="guidSubBullets">o "What can we...?"</p>
            <p class="guidSubBullets">o - "How can we ...?"</p>

            <h2>Role of Leader</h2>
            <p class="guidBullets">• Clarifies purpose.</p>
            <p class="guidBullets">• Outlines facts.</p>
            <p class="guidBullets">• Gives question for discussion.</p>


            <h2>Role of Group</h2>
            <p class="guidBullets">• Brainstorms ideas.</p>
            <p class="guidBullets">• Selects actions.</p>

            <p class="guidPara">Decides responsibilities and timing.</p>
